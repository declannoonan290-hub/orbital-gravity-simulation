Project: Orbital Motion & Gravity Simulation
Overview

This project is a self-directed learning exercise created to explore how gravity and orbital motion work in a simplified, visual way. The goal was not to build a perfect scientific model, but to better understand how theoretical physics concepts translate into computational logic.

The simulation models basic gravitational interaction and orbital behavior using introductory physics assumptions. It was built as part of my ongoing learning while studying Elementary Education with a minor in Astronomy/Astrophysics at Worcester State University.

What I Was Learning

How physical systems can be represented step-by-step in code

Translating equations and concepts into logical processes

Breaking complex systems into manageable components

Debugging through observation and iteration

Tools & Concepts

Basic programming logic

Mathematical relationships (gravity, velocity, acceleration)

Iterative simulation loops

Visual output for understanding system behavior

Why This Project Matters

This project reflects my interest in space and physics, as well as my approach to learning: start simple, build understanding gradually, and focus on clarity rather than complexity. It also reinforced the importance of clear documentation and step-by-step thinking when working with technical material.
